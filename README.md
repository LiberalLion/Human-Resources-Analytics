  - Plots of some select meaningful variables against eachother for exploratory data analysis.
  - Model building using the algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbor, Linear regression, Random forests, SVM.
  - Feature Engineering: creating dummy variables and comparison of algorithms' accuracy before and after feature engineering.
  - Association rule mining.
